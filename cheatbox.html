          Taurus - A Taurus Moon belies a creature of habit. At your core, all you desire is a home full of silk sheets, exquisitely prepared food, and an indulgent soak in the tub with a warm, fluffy robe waiting. Stability is also a Taurus Moon thing, which might seem at odds with your Sun sign, but at your core, you desire a select few to become your chosen family, no matter how slowly you get there.
          Gemini - Truly cerebral, a Gemini Moon will process feelings through words. This can mean that you need a few minutes to get your witty response together because you want to sound smart without revealing too much of your feelings. You take your time to make decisions because you’re weighing all the possible outcomes—logically and emotionally—and because Gemini’s skip from one idea to the next. And the next. And the next.
          Cancer - The Moon is at home in Cancer. Having this nurturing sign in the role of your Moon sign means that you have a preternatural desire to look after everyone and everything in your path. And, let’s be honest, the world needs more of that. But someone with such a caretaking interior also needs to remember to look after themselves. A hot bath and a little time alone never hurt anyone.
          Leo - Proud and confident, a Leo Moon sign can be hard to ignore. You’re super compassionate and expressive on the inside–but how are you doing on the outside? You might be someone who mirrors others in their actions, emotions, even gestures. Since Leo is ruled by the fiery Sun, a Moon in Leo can expect to feel a little push and pull between their inner and outer lives. Take care to protect your own energy.
          Virgo - Naturally curious, a Virgo Moon is full of wisdom. Virgos are analytical in nature. They’re also highly opinionated and super ethical. Virgo Moons tend to need quite a lot of soothing as you do worry more than a little. However, you also tend to turn your traits outward as you’re pretty dedicated to service and you love to be helpful, so you have all kinds of advice to offer, whether solicited or not.
          Libra - Natural mediators, Libra Moons are happiest keeping the peace. A die-hard romantic, love is all you need. In fact, you might even go do far as to start a romance while you’re still involved in another one. You love being swept away and are more than adept at keeping the peace, so you’ll do well moving between relationships until you find the one.
          Scorpio - Scorpio is known for its high-octane intensity. With this water sign as your Moon, you tend to have volatile emotions and can be vulnerable to absorbing the emotions and moods of others. Boundaries need to be honored in your relationships and negative vibes guarded against. Your waters run deep, Scorpio. You share your buried truths with only a few chosen souls, so you tend to desire deep personal connections. You exude trustworthiness because others see how important your secrets are to you.
          Sagittarius - People born with the moon in Sagittarius are usually very positive people. They love their freedom, and cannot stay cooped up indoors. Their outlook towards life is happy-go-lucky. They are very strong and active and indulge in activities which require physical efforts such as sports. They love to travel and meet new people, and learn about new cultures. They are most cheerful in open spaces. 
          Capricon - Capricorns are known for their hard work and business savvy, but under the influence of the Moon, that also means that you can take your emotions pretty seriously. Long-term success is everything to you, in any collaboration whether business, romance, or friendship. You’re not super sensitive but you do take your feelings, when you feel them, as an important signal.
          Aquarius - The most humanitarian sign, Aquarius always wants to do the right thing—even when that means putting the greater good above your own needs. Because you respond to life based on your values rather than your emotions, you’re more cerebral than emotional and you don’t understand why peeps need to lose their schizz to prove a point. Be aware of your tendency to start to detach from others.
          Pisces - Have you always been considered by others to be dreamy? Accused of being off in your own world? A Pisces Moon is actually quite sensitive and empathetic. And magnetic. As a Moon sign, you’re rarely judgmental. You’ll advise if someone asks for your intuition and you’ll be known for your otherworldly creativity and generosity. Deeply spiritual, Pisces Moons tend to be described as old souls and have a lot of answer to questions that haven’t even been asked yet.`}],
