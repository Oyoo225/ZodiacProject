        <h1>12 Zodaic Sign</h1>
        <section id="aries">
            <h3>Aries &#9800;</h3>
            <img src="image/Aries.jpeg">
            <p>Aries loves to be number one, so it’s no surprise that these audacious rams are the first sign of the zodiac. 
                Bold and ambitious, Aries dives headfirst into even the most challenging situations (which is appropriate, since the body part associated with Aries is the head).
                 Like their fellow fire signs, Leo and Sagittarius, Aries is a passionate, motivated, and confident leader who builds community with their cheerful disposition and relentless determination. Uncomplicated and direct in their approach, they often get frustrated by exhaustive details and unnecessary nuances.
                  They like things quick and dirty, a temperament also reflected in their sexual proclivities.</p>
                  <h4>History</h4>
                  <p>In astrology, Aries is the first sign of the zodiac, considered as governing the period from about March 21 to about April 19. Its representation as a ram is identified with the Egyptian god Amon and, in Greek mythology, with the ram with the golden fleece, on the back of which Phrixus, the son of King Athamas, safely fled Thessaly to Colchis, where he sacrificed the ram to Zeus, who placed it in the heavens as the constellation. The ram’s golden fleece was recovered by Jason, leader of the Argonauts.</p>

            <h3>Taurus &#9801;</h3>
            <img src="image/Taurus1.jpeg">
            <p>Taurus is an earth sign represented by the bull. Like their celestial spirit animal,
                 Taureans enjoy relaxing in serene, bucolic environments, surrounded by soft sounds, soothing aromas, and succulent flavors. Taurus is ruled by Venus, the enchanting planet that governs love, beauty, and money. Taurus’s Venusian influence make this earth sign the most sensual of the zodiac: These cosmic oxen are enchanted by any physical manifestation of comfort and luxury. 
                Pleasure is a necessity for epicurean Taureans and they feel most content when pampered. 
                (Taurus governs the neck, so neck caresses are especially irresistible to these bulls.)</p>
                <h4>History</h4>
                <p>In astrology, Taurus is the second sign of the zodiac, considered as governing that portion of the year from about April 20 to about May 20. Its representation as a bull is related to the Greek myth of Zeus, who assumed the form of a bull to abduct Europa.</p>

            <img src="image/Gemini.jpeg">
            <p>Have you ever been so busy that you wished you could clone yourself just to get everything done? That's the Gemini experience in a nutshell. Spontaneous, playful, and adorably erratic, Gemini is driven by its insatiable curiosity. Appropriately symbolized by the celestial twins, 
                this air sign was interested in so many pursuits that it had to double itself.</p>
                <p></p>

                <p>In astrology, Gemini is the third sign of the zodiac, considered as governing the period from about May 21 to about June 21.

            <h3>Leo &#9804;</h3>
            <img src="image/Leo.jpeg">
            <p>Roll out the red carpet because Leo has arrived. Passionate, loyal, and infamously dramatic, Leo is represented by the lion
                 and these spirited fire signs are the kings and queens of the celestial jungle. They're delighted to embrace their royal status
                 : Vivacious, theatrical, and fiery, Leos love to bask in the spotlight and celebrate… well, themselves. </p>

        <section id="virgo">
            <h3>Virgo &#9805;</h3>
            <img src="image/virgo.jpeg">
            <p>You know the expression, "if you want something done, give it to a busy person?"
                 Well, that definitely is the Virgo anthem. Virgos are logical, practical, and systematic in their approach to life. 
                 Virgo is an earth sign historically represented by the goddess of wheat and agriculture, an association 
                 that speaks to Virgo's deep-rooted presence in the material world. This earth sign is a perfectionist
                  at heart and isn’t afraid to improve skills through diligent and consistent practice.</p>
                  <h4>History</h4>
                  <p>In astrology, Virgo is the sixth sign of the zodiac, considered as governing the period from about August 23 to about September 22. It is represented as a young maiden carrying a sheaf of wheat. She is variously identified as a fertility goddess (the Babylonian and Assyrian Ishtar, among others) or the harvest maiden (the Greek Persephone and others).</p>

        <section id="libra">
            <h3>Libra &#9806;</h3>
            <img src="image/libra.jpeg">
            <p>Balance, harmony, and justice define Libra energy. As a cardinal air sign, Libra is represented by the scales (interestingly, the only inanimate object of the zodiac), an association that reflects Libra's fixation on establishing equilibrium. Libra is obsessed with symmetry and strives to create equilibrium in all areas of life — especially when it comes to matters of the heart.</p>
        <h4>History</h4>
        <p>In astrology, Libra is the seventh sign of the zodiac, considered as governing the period from about September 22 to about October 23. It is represented by a woman (sometimes identified with Astraea, the Roman goddess of justice), holding a balance scale or by the balance alone.</p>

            <img src="image/1000_F_281296725_wpc7kENmSr1YUEP9iLOvr5C4DSg3J6e5.jpg">
            <p>Elusive and mysterious, Scorpio is one of the most misunderstood signs of the zodiac. Scorpio is a water sign that uses emotional energy as fuel, cultivating powerful wisdom through both the physical and unseen realms. In fact, Scorpio derives its extraordinary courage from its psychic abilities, which is what makes this sign one of the most complicated, dynamic signs of the zodiac.</p>
            <h4>History</h4>
            <p>In astrology, Scorpius (or Scorpio) is the eighth sign of the zodiac, considered as governing the period from about October 24 to about November 21. Its representation as a scorpion is related to the Greek legend of the scorpion that stung Orion to death (said to be why Orion sets as Scorpius rises in the sky). Another Greek myth relates that a scorpion caused the horses of the Sun to bolt when they were being driven for a day by the inexperienced youth Phaeton.</p>

            <h3>Sagittarius &#9808;</h3>
            <img src="image/sagittarius.jpeg">
            <p>Oh, the places Sagittarius goes! But… actually. This fire sign knows no bounds. Represented by the archer, Sagittarians are always on a quest for knowledge. The last fire sign of the zodiac, Sagittarius launches its many pursuits like blazing arrows, chasing after geographical, intellectual, and spiritual adventures. </p>
            <h4>History</h4>
            <p>In astrology, Sagittarius is the ninth sign of the zodiac, considered as governing the period from about November 22 to about December 21.

            <h3>Capricorn &#9809;</h3>
            <img src="image/capricorn.png">
            <p>What is the most valuable resource? For Capricorn, the answer is clear: Time. Capricorn is climbing the mountain straight to the top and knows that patience, perseverance, and dedication is the only way to scale. The last earth sign of the zodiac, Capricorn, is represented by the sea-goat, a mythological creature with the body of a goat and the tail of a fish. Accordingly, Capricorns are skilled at navigating both the material and emotional realms.</p>
            <h4>History</h4>
            <p>In astronomy, Capricornus is a zodiacal constellation lying in the southern sky between Aquarius and Sagittarius, at about 21 hours right ascension and 20° south declination. Its stars are faint; Deneb Algedi (Arabic for “kid’s tail”) is the brightest star, with a magnitude of 2.9. Capricornus usually refers to the constellation, and Capricorn usually refers to the astrological sign.</p>

            <h3>Aquarius &#9810;</h3>
            <img src="image/aquarius.jpeg">
            <p>Despite the "aqua" in its name, Aquarius is actually the last air sign of the zodiac. Innovative, progressive, and shamelessly revolutionary, Aquarius is represented by the water bearer, the mystical healer who bestows water, or life, upon the land. Accordingly, Aquarius is the most humanitarian astrological sign. At the end of the day, Aquarius is dedicated to making the world a better place.</p>
            <h4>History</h4>
            <p>In astrology, Aquarius is the 11th sign of the zodiac, considered as governing the period from about January 20 to about February 18. Its representation as a man pouring a stream of water out of a jug came about, it has been suggested, because in ancient times the rising of Aquarius coincided in the Middle East with a period of floods and rain.</p>

            <h3>Pisces &#9811;</h3>
            <img src="image/pisces.jpeg">
            <p>TIf you looked up the word "psychic" in the dictionary, there would definitely be a picture of Pisces next to it. Pisces is the most intuitive, sensitive, and empathetic sign of the entire zodiac — and that’s because it’s the last of the last. As the final sign, Pisces has absorbed every lesson — the joys and the pain, the hopes and the fears — learned by all of the other signs. It's symbolized by two fish swimming in opposite directions, representing the constant division of Pisces' attention between fantasy and reality.</p>
            <h4>History</h4>
            <p>In astrology, Pisces is the 12th sign of the zodiac, considered as governing the period from about February 19 to about March 20. Its representation as two fish tied together is usually related to the Greek myth of Aphrodite and Eros, who jumped into a river to escape the monster Typhon and changed into fish, or, alternatively, the two fish that carried them to safety.</p>
